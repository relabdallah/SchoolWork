//PURPOSE: This function simply tests the copy constructor of the slist class
//and adds 6 to a the rear of copiedList and displays the list
//PARAMETER: list passed by value becomes copiedList
void CopyTest(slist copiedList)

  cout << "in copy test" << endl;

//PURPOSE of the Program: **
//Algorithm/Design: **
int main()

  int temp;
  int counter = 1;

 //1.Create a 5 element list with  1,2,3,4,5 (L1)
  cout << counter << endl; counter++;
  **
  //2.Pass the list to a client function called CopyTest to 
  //test your copy constructor.
  cout << counter << endl; counter++;
  **
  cout << "-- After copytest --- " << endl;
  //3.Display L1 (this should still be a 5 element list)
  cout << counter << endl; counter++;
  **
  cout << "-- Testing operator overloading ---" << endl;

  //4.Do L1 = L1;
  cout << counter << endl; counter++;
  **
  //5.Display L1    (this should still be 1 2 3 4 5)
  cout << counter << endl; counter++;
  **
  //6.Create a 4 element list L2 with 7,8,9,10.
  cout << counter << endl; counter++;
  **
  //7.Display L2
  cout << counter << endl; counter++;
  **
  //8.Do L2 = L1;  (L2 becomes 5 elements 1,2,3,4,5)
  cout << counter << endl; counter++;
  **
  //9.Display L2.
  cout << counter << endl; counter++;
  **
  //10.Remove a rear node from L1. (This should not affect L2).
  cout << counter << endl; counter++;
  **
  //11.Display L1.   (L1 is 1,2,3,4)
  cout << counter << endl; counter++;
  **
  //12.Display L1 again. (4 elements . just to make sure)
  cout << counter << endl; counter++;
  **
  //13.Display L2 again. (still 5 elements 1,2,3,4,5)
  cout << counter << endl; counter++;
